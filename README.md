# Interactive Form with React
## Demo
https://fabianlins.github.io/Coding-Task-2-Interactive-Form/

## Used technologies/ frameworks
###### I make use of those technologies/ frameworks for my project:
	•	React without TypeScript
	•	(Vanilla) SCSS

This time I used React without TypeScript since it is a simple task where it will delay the task more than giving benefits.

## Used 3rd Party Libraries
I make use of those 3rd party libraries:

| Name | Explanation |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| React | Modern JavaScript Framework|
| Vite | To initialize the React + TypeScript combination|


## Those components need to be installed locally:
	•	nodejs

## Installation / execution of the projects

You have to insert these commands in the command line / bash:

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/FabianLins/Coding-Task-2-Interactive-Form/ lins-coding-task-interactive-form
$ cd lins-coding-task-interactive-form
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

## What did I learn and think about this project
I had to deal with CORS issues but did not go deep into this since it was not required and I want to host it without backend on GitHub pages. So I went with a local file. It also made some issues because GitHub fetched the HTML of the link and not the content of the txt file. This is why I have uncommmented the inital solution and added a string with line breaks.
